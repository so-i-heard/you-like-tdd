# Quick start

### Import, option 1:
create a folder for a project and from command line
```
git clone https://github.com/so-i-heard/you-like-tdd.git
```
then Intellij -> file -> open -> select "build.gradle" in dialog -> OK -> click "Open as Project"

### Import, option 2:
Intellij -> file -> new -> "Project from Version Control..."

# Test/Run
<p>on the very right side there will be a "Gradle" menu. In there you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>you-like-tdd -> Tasks -> verification -> test</li>
<li>you-like-tdd -> Tasks -> application -> run</li>
</ul>
	
But before you can play, gotta fix those tests!

Good luck.
