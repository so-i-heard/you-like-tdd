step 1)
create a folder for a project and
git clone https://github.com/so-i-heard/you-like-tdd.git

step 2)
Intellij -> file -> open -> select "build.gradle" in dialog -> OK -> click "Open as Project"

step 3)
on the very right side there will be a "Gradle" menu. In there you can:
	- you-like-tdd -> Tasks -> verification -> test
	- you-like-tdd -> Tasks -> application -> run
	
But before you can play, gotta fix those tests!

Good luck.
