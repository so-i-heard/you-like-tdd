step 1)
	a) create a folder for a project and from command line
	   git clone https://github.com/so-i-heard/you-like-tdd.git
	   then Intellij -> file -> open -> select "build.gradle" in dialog -> OK -> click "Open as Project"
	b) Intellij -> file -> new -> "Project from Version Control..."

step 2)
on the very right side there will be a "Gradle" menu. In there you can:
	- you-like-tdd -> Tasks -> verification -> test
	- you-like-tdd -> Tasks -> application -> run
	
But before you can play, gotta fix those tests!

Good luck.
